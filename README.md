# SENG 533 Final Project â€“ Performance Evaluation of Wiki.js

This repository contains the final project submission for SENG 533: Performance Evaluation. The objective of this study is to analyze the scalability and responsiveness of Wiki.js, a Node.js-based content management system, under various simulated load conditions. The project includes system deployment, load testing using Artillery, and a caching optimization implemented via Redis.

## Live Deployments

- Caching Proxy: https://seng533finalproject-production.up.railway.app

## Technologies and Tools

- Node.js and Express.js
- Wiki.js
- Redis
- Artillery (load testing)
- Railway (cloud deployment)
- Docker (optional)

## Project Overview

This project explores the effects of Redis caching on the performance of Wiki.js. We simulate a variety of traffic patterns including baseline, moderate, high load, burst, and spike scenarios. Without caching, the system experienced latency spikes and failed requests under heavy load. The introduction of a Redis caching layer, implemented through a custom proxy service, resulted in significantly improved response times and 100% request success rates under all test conditions.

Clustering and load balancing strategies were considered during the evaluation phase. However, due to the substantial performance improvements achieved through Redis caching alone, these approaches were not deployed as part of the final optimization pipeline. They remain valuable for more dynamic or CPU-intensive use cases.
